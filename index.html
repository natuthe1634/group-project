<h1>I am the person under the fig tree</h1>
<p>this might seem odd but it is what is written aboout me in the bible or atleast the name,even though therer are alot of things that woould describe me as a person i always chose this bible verse since i belive to thrive to that possibillity of becoming the persone it refers to.</p>
<h2>I love to spend time in natural surroundings</h2>
<p>when i say natural surroundings its easy to imagine nature it self, being occupied in activities like hicking,swimming in lakes,hunting when the seaoson comes.</p>
<p>These surroundings are peaceful and quite and sometimes dangerous because they bring the thrill of being in the unknown worl thats living amoung us</p>
<h3>These are my recommendations of natural wonders in nevada</h3>
<ol>
    <li>zion park </li>
    <li>red rock </li>
    <li> lake lasvegas</li>
</ol>
